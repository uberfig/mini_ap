# mini_ap
 
this project is a rewrite of my older project https://github.com/uberfig/activity_playground

this project intends to be more stable with unit testing for activitystream types, tokio-postgres instead of sqlx, and refinery for built in migrations. This project may also include the option to use sqlite instead in the more distant future

for setting up your environment to run, check [environment setup](environment_setup.md)
